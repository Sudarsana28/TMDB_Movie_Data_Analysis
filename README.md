# TMDB_Movie_Data_Analysis
This dataset is a collection of about 10,000 movies from the The Movie Database(TMDb) with each movie categorized under a list of 21 columns.

The TMDB Movie dataset was one of the curated Udacity Datasets for making Data Analysis.

## Steps carried out in the Data Analysis:  
• Posing questions on the dataset we chose by looking at relationships between multiple variables. Analyzing at least one dependent and three independent variables using Numpy & Pandas.  
• Using the gathered data for the next phase of Data Wrangling like Assessing and Cleaning including- Checking for nulls, duplicates, removing columns unnecessary for our Data Analysis and further wrangling the data to create 1:1 mapping between the different columns making it suitable for the next phase of Analysis.  
• Exploratory Data Analysis- Building plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn Python libraries for Data Visualization that help us in answering our posed questions through visual representions.  
• Documenting the Conclusions arrived from the Data Analysis.
